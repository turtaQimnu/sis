You can then use the SMTP servers for your email marketing campaigns, by entering their information in your email client or software. However, you should be careful not to abuse the SMTP servers or send spam emails, as this may result in legal consequences or blacklisting of your IP address.
 
SMTP Scaner is a useful tool for finding workable SMTP servers, but it is not the only one.

Whatever tool you use, make sure you respect the rules and regulations of email marketing and do not spam or harm anyone with your emails. Email marketing can be a powerful way to promote your products or services, but only if done ethically and responsibly.

How to Choose the Best SMTP Server for Your Email Marketing Campaigns
 
Not all SMTP servers are created equal. Some may have better performance, security, reliability, and deliverability than others. Therefore, it is important to choose the best SMTP server for your email marketing campaigns, based on your goals and budget.
 
Some factors to consider when choosing an SMTP server are:
 
- The reputation of the SMTP server. A good reputation means that the SMTP server has a high delivery rate and a low bounce rate. It also means that the SMTP server is not blacklisted by any email service providers or spam filters. You can check the reputation of an SMTP server by using online tools such as Sender Score or MX Toolbox.
- The features of the SMTP server. Some SMTP servers may offer more features than others, such as analytics, tracking, segmentation, personalization, automation, and integration. These features can help you optimize your email marketing campaigns and measure their effectiveness.
- The cost of the SMTP server. Depending on your email volume and frequency, you may need to pay a monthly or annual fee for using an SMTP server. Some SMTP servers may offer free plans or trials, but they may have limitations or restrictions. You should compare the prices and plans of different SMTP servers and choose the one that suits your needs and budget.

Some examples of popular and reliable SMTP servers are:

- SendGrid. SendGrid is a cloud-based email service that provides a scalable and flexible SMTP server for sending transactional and marketing emails. It has a high delivery rate and a robust API that allows you to integrate with various platforms and applications. It also offers advanced features such as analytics, segmentation, personalization, automation, and templates.
- Mailgun. Mailgun is another cloud-based email service that offers a powerful and easy-to-use SMTP server for sending transactional and marketing emails. It has a high delivery rate and a simple API that lets you send emails from any application or website. It also provides features such as analytics, tracking, validation, and testing.
- Amazon SES. Amazon SES is a part of Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides a low-cost and reliable SMTP server for sending transactional and marketing emails. It has a high delivery rate and a flexible API that enables you to send emails from any AWS service or application. It also supports features such as analytics, monitoring, feedback loops, and DKIM/SPF authentication.

How to Test Your SMTP Server Before Sending Emails
 
Before you start sending emails with your SMTP server, it is advisable to test it first to make sure it works properly and does not have any issues or errors. Testing your SMTP server can help you avoid wasting time and money on failed or bounced emails.
 
Some ways to test your SMTP server are:

- Use an online tool such as Mail Tester or GlockApps to check your email deliverability, spam score, authentication, and content. These tools can help you identify any problems or areas of improvement in your email settings or design.
- Use a test email account such as Gmail or Outlook to send yourself an email using your SMTP server. This can help you verify that your email arrives in the inbox and not in the spam folder. You can also check how your email looks on different devices and browsers.
- Use a test email list such as MailPoet or MailChimp to send a small batch of emails to a sample of your subscribers using your SMTP server. This can help you measure the open rate, click rate, bounce rate, and unsubscribe rate of your emails. You can also get feedback from your subscribers about your email content and quality.

By testing your SMTP server before sending emails, you can ensure that your email marketing campaigns run smoothly and effectively.
